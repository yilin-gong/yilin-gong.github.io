		Here is the inspiration pages that I want to mimic. 
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://curiousdrz.com">First</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://demo.sharkthemes.com/mik-personal/">Second</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://colorlib.com/preview/#personalportfolio">Third</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		They have a similar structure, which all have the nav bar at the top, the picture at the first section, structured in 2 columns. I really like this sturcture, because I believe that people can standout to increase impression. Then, they have the detailed info, the thumbnails of their works. Audiences can go to their work directly by clicking the thumbnails. When I first looked at them, I have a clear mind about what I am looking for because of simple and clean structure.
