                Game of Throne related to the real life

              </h2>
              <p>
  Since the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, the audience rating has been soaring, and it has won 12 awards in the 67th Emmy Awards. I checked out the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dasbootstrapping/game-of-thrones-episode-data">Kaggle</a>, and <b>I found an average of more than 6 million plays per episode, with a average IMDB score close to 9.</b> This grand dark epic of the Middle Ages in Europe tells the story of the nine families in the continent of Westeros fighting against the "iron throne", which is a symbol of supreme power. The reason why so many fans around the world are crazy about it is that it not only gathers many family disputes in different power centers but also shows the fictional conflict of court power and kingdom tribe fighting in the middle ages Exciting scene. According to the article <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838158609386635'>‘Perception of Gender Equality on Television and in Social Reality’</a>, TV programs are closely related to real life. Therefore, I will focus on the three parts of this TV show, the Game of Thrones, to see how it might relate to real life. 
  </p>
  <p>
  First, in relationships, I think the reason why this TV show is very popular, is that it provided a real society. When we think about society or interpersonal relationships, the number is large, since we will meet endless people and make many friends in our life. The Game of Thrones tries to creating a real-world of flesh and blood, so we can see more than ten big countries, dozens of small countries, and hundreds of people as a "power struggle”. Such a setting is undoubtedly magnificent and time-consuming because there are many characters and each character has its own personality, relationships. If I watch other TV shows, I felt many of them have similar settings, characters, and stories, but this one is unique. This enhances the sense of substitution, which is why it is so popular. I feel like it's a story that's happening, similar as the ring, not a script that's being created.

  <p>
  Secondly, in society, it will represent a patriarchal society. On the <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones#interfaces">Github dataset</a>, how much time women and men are on-screen during each season, shows that the female has a smaller screen time compared to the male. Also, on the words that female and male say during each season shows the same pattern. I checked out the most frequently words using in dialogue, by using the dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gunnvant/game-of-thrones-srt">Kaggle</a>, the words father, king, man caught my attention, because the words such as mother, queen, woman are not commanly used. To be sure, this may be due to various reasons such as role set. But I have to admit that, as a legend that created a new world, with perfect characterization, it undoubtedly reflects the real life, that is, the inherent thought, what men should do and what women should do, as well as on such a new road.

  The last but not least, in economic, In fact, the game of the throne also contains a lot of knowledge of investment and financing, or, in the final analysis, its essence is a game of capital. The production and redistribution of wealth in the last season of Game of Thrones cost about $100 million. In the middle ages of 1300, the real GDP of Britain was only about 40 million pounds. The play does not hide the extreme poverty of ordinary people living in the magic version of the Middle Ages: therefore, we see that the rulers are indifferent to the indecency, disease, and famine suffered by the general public; citizens are regarded as the common things on the earth used by their rulers to improve their lives. So how did we move from the Middle Ages to the modern? The answer is the league. The same as Game of Thrones, the alliance is a necessary and key existence. We have many world wide organizations, such as WTO, Union Nations. Perhaps because of the barbarism and betrayal of the rulers, the alliance is always changing. But to maximize the benefits, we must know how to communicate and unite.

  <p>
  In conclusion, a TV show is the epitome of reality. It can reflect the interpersonal relationships, social and economic. And often close to reality, to let the audience have a strong resonance, let each episode been popular. Although some characters can't fight in reality, it still doesn't prevent it from becoming the best Realistic TV series in my heart, because it is created based on real society, and every detail will make the audience resonate and immerse.
