                  Introduction
               </h4>
               <p>
               The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wallstreet-bet</a> must be the most interesting and fascinating thing that happened last week. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robinhood-gamestop-stock/">What they do</a> is to group retail investors to fight against short organization. This action happened quickly and dramatically so that no one can expect the result. As an information science student, when I first saw this event, I started to think what data can I dig or collect into to explore and analyze this event deeper immediately, to dig why this action happens at this specific time and what might it result. I will looking for

               <h4>
               Explanation
               </h4>
               <p>
               In the beginning, in the magical 2020, everything somehow related to COVID-19, even in 2021. Although this is the player's spontaneous action to prevent their childhood company from acquisition, it raises me a question, why in this time. I checked GameStop’s stock in a year view, I found that this stock is kind of stable since January 2020, and has slightly increased in the fall. If the player truly wants to protect their company, they probably will do this at the beginning, instead of waiting for a year. In my opinion, rather than protecting, believe more people don’t have as much entertainment to do as before, because of COVID-19, so that they turned to the stock market for stimulus. By researching the data on COVID-19, to see is this really the spontaneous action of the players or is fueled by the backstage.

               Secondly, it is important to research data of Reddit, to see their view activities and analyze the frequency of the words, compare and contrast them with the COVID-19 data, to verify the hypothesis and the reason why Reddit ban this subreddit, to see if it to protect users or is it manipulated by capital. When I checked on Reddit, I saw tons of the NSFW and Not in line with the mainstream values of society content. Hence, Reddit and discord banned their channel seems to become the fuse of making the retail investors more outrageous. If the appearances happen before, this will rise from financial conflict to social conflict. And this has something to do with the laissez-faire of the platform. Although the error of this platform is certain, it is equally important to trace the root cause. Only by fully understanding the details of the event can the conflict be kept under control.

               Last but not least, looking at the stock data might bring unexpected results. For example, by comparing and contrasting the Reddit data, we can find the patterns that the retail investors made in previous bets. From there, we would have a clear view of how much wealth do the investors have. Since they against the organizations and the elite group of people. And I saw some of them even using their tuition to join this event. After more capital joins as well, those people might lose all their money, and cause a finical crisis. By analyzing those data, we can have the general perspective about when is the best time for retail investors to sell their stock better and might warn people how dangerous to invest this stock is and prevent people from depression.

               <h4>
               Conclusion
               </h4>
               <p>
               In conclusion, for now, the Wallstreet-bet bet successfully, but <a href="https://capital.com/gamestop-stock-forecast-will-the-market-bonanza-last">no one will reconcile to lose their money,</a>  especially for organizations, which already lose billions of dollars. In this complex society, the causes and results are various, the COVID-19 might trigger more retail investors to join the bet, the reddit’s behavior seems to improve the bet become more insane. However, behind this bet, I want to figure out what might result in those people who don’t have lots of money and join this event, and to the U.S.’s finical and social conflict. And I believe that these data can answer all my questions.
