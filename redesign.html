		The last week web page:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="original/index.html">Index</a></li>

		For making the website looks great, I used:
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>For each pages</p>
		<li>Because I saw every website has the nav bar at top, so I used the nav bar from bootstrap too, to make sure the audience can search the topic quick and simple.</li>
		<li>The columns and container. Because I want the page to have some margins, centered on the page so that I used the container on each page. For the columns, I used the col and row on almost every page. However, when I deployed to the page, it seems to have some errors, which have extra space between rows and columns, or columns themselves. Therefore, I modify the local CSS file to make sure they have the correct outfit. </li>
		<li>I used the button on the home page and the contact me page. I chose the blue color because I believe that will fit the color scheme of the whole website. In fact, those buttons just look like a button, but actually, they are the like but have the button shape, and function, to direct to another page. If adding the href to the button, the text will look like a link instead of a button, appearing in text color.</li>

	</ul>
